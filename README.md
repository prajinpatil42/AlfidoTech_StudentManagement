Project Explanation: Student Management System<br>

Project Overview:
The Student Management System is a comprehensive software application developed to assist educational institutions in managing student-related data efficiently. It offers features such as student registration, course enrollment, grade assignment, and result generation. This project is implemented using Java Spring Boot as the framework, with various technologies including JPA, Hibernate, Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and MySQL to create a robust and user-friendly system.
<br>
Key Features:

Student Registration: New students can register by providing their personal information, such as name, contact details, and academic background. This data is securely stored in the MySQL database.

Course Enrollment: Students can select the courses they wish to enroll in during the registration process. The system stores this information and associates it with each student, allowing for streamlined course management.

Teacher Interaction: The system provides a platform for teachers to interact with students. They can access student profiles, monitor attendance, assign grades, and communicate important information.

Grade Assignment: Teachers can assign grades to students based on their performance in each course. These grades are linked to specific subjects and are an essential component of the student's academic record.

Result Generation: Once all grades have been assigned, the system calculates and generates results for each student. Students can access their results through the system.

Database-Driven: The project utilizes Java Spring Boot, JPA, and Hibernate to create a database-driven application, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of student data.

User Interface: Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap are used to develop an intuitive and user-friendly web-based interface that administrators, teachers, and students can easily navigate.

Technology Stack:

Java Spring Boot: The project's foundation, providing a framework for building web applications.
JPA and Hibernate: For object-relational mapping and database management.
Thymeleaf: A template engine for creating dynamic web pages.
HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap: For web page design and layout.
MySQL: The database used to store student and course data.
